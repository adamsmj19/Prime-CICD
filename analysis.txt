1.	EC2PrimeDeployRole is assigned to the EC2 instance to grant permission to deploy applications and manage infrastructure on the EC2 instance.
2.	The appspec.yml file defines how the application is deployed on the EC2 instance. It makes sure that the application runs after being deployed.
3.	If the EC2 instance were in a private subnet we would need to find a way for the EC2 to deploy without internet access. We would need to creat an S3 VPC Endpoint and a CodeDeploy VPC Endpoint so they can communicate directly with each other.
